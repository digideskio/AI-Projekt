## Eclipse ##

### Code style ###

Import Custom Java Clean Up Profile.xml and Custom Java Formatter.xml in Eclipse under:

Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> [Clean Up / Formatter]


### Notes ###
we need almost constant node expansion time
has to do with how to check repeated states
and check for deadlocks

2 million node expansions/sec is alot
50-100k is good.

Work locally as much as possible, the server is slow.
